  <h2>Summary</h2>
  HTML is a <em> HyperText Markup language</em> which is based
  on text with some basic text with some computer commands <span>markup</span>
  to tell it how to behave.
  <br><br>
  This is one of the pieces that consolidates the internet. Html is the protocol between
  the user computer and servers. Servers are computers meant to
  host most of the internet's data.

  <h4>The syntax</h4>
  An element is composed of opening and closing tags.
  Opening tags are <span>&lt; &gt;</span> and it's the way to tell computer to do something from this point forward.
  <p>Closing tags are <span>&lt;/&gt;</span> needed to tell it to stop that element from taking effect. This changes depending of the type of elements.
  There are void elements that don't require a closing tag.
  <!--  Also read about self closing tags, not on course. -->

  <h4>Attributes</h4>
